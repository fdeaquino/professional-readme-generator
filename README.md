# PROFESSIONAL README GENERATOR

## Description
README.md files play significant roles in Web Development because they are the "store front" of any project. Projects can benefit from high-quality README files by displaying key information to prospective contributers and intended users. This easy-to-use README Generator gives web developers some of their time back by producing a README file with essential information from user input. Using this tool gives Web Developers an opportunity to be more time efficient with their projects. 

Building this README Generator gave me an opportunity to use my newfound npm inquirer and node.js skills. This was also an opportunity for me to use other skills like reading documentation and using Markdown syntax.
